what is an instance and object?
instance and object are same thing,when we allocate memory for any class using new keyword
that means we instantiated all the characteristics and properties of that class.
Whereas reference is a variable where it points to a object.
Object is an instance of the class .Its a real life entity of a class,means it has allocated by memory.Whereas class is blueprint or template 
which defines the properties and behaviour.

what is a structured Programming?
Structured programming is a programming model where we define control flow clearly and the program is 
divided into multiple modules.So,that code can be reuseable and understandable.
In structured programming the statements are excecuted in top-down sequence.All the programming models have the structured programming model
including oops.

STATIC:
=>Whenever we require to create a single variable for all instance of an object.Static variable comes in a picture,for
all instances of an class will have single static variable.
=>The static var is same for all objects.so we can access the static var using the class name and whereas non-static var are accessble
using the object name.
=> static var are intiallised using the static block and non-static var using constructor.
=> static block is executed during loading the class and its excecuted only once.All static blocks are follows the sequence. 
=> After all static block excecution is completed.constructor is excecuted after the instantiating the class.
=> non-static var are accessble by non-static methods.
=> static variable are accesseble by static and non-static methods.
